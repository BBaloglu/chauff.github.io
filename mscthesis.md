# Notes on MSc theses at Lambda-Lab

## Setup

- Create an Overleaf project, use *MSc-thesis-full-name* as project title and invite me to it.
  - Every chapter gets two rounds of comments.
- Use GitHub to keep track of your project and add me to your project.
  - Add a `README.md` where you keep track of the meetings we had and what we discussed (action points to take).
  - Add a folder `papers` where you keep track of all the papers you read for your thesis.
  - Add a folder `code` to keep track of all your code. 
  - When you run any experiments, keep track of which code version you ran (use hash commits or tag the repo).
- Make sure to submit the two required forms on time (one to form the thesis committee and one to fix the defense date).
