title: On the Impact of Group Size on Collaborative Search Effectiveness

While today's Web search engines are designed for single-user search, over the years research efforts have shown that 
complex information needs - which are explorative, open-ended and multi-faceted - can be answered more
efficiently and effectively when searching in collaboration. 

**Collaborative search** (and sensemaking) research has investigated techniques, algorithms and interface affordances to 
gain insights and improve the collaborative search process. It is not hard to imagine that the size of the group collaborating on
a search task significantly influences the group's behaviour and search effectiveness.

However, a common denominator across almost all existing studies is a **fixed** group size - usually either pairs, triads or in a 
few cases four users collaborating. Investigations into larger group sizes and the impact of group size dynamics on users' 
behaviour and search metrics have so far rarely been considered - and when, then only in a simulation setup. 

In our recently accepted Information Retrieval journal article (published some time in 2019):

```bibtex
@article{IRJ2019ColSearchGroupSizes,
  author = {Felipe Moraes, Kilian Grashoff and Claudia Hauff},
  title = {On the Impact of Group Size on Collaborative Search Effectiveness},
  journal = {Information Retrieval Journal},
  year = {2019}
}
```

we took aim at this research gap and explored the following question: **What is the impact of group
size on collaborative search effectiveness?** 

First, we categorized previous research in a neat table:

Evidently, user studies with collaborating pairs are the most popular. Few studies work with self-selected search tasks, the setup with
a fixed set of search tasks is the most popular.

## Our contributions

Through a **large-scale user experiment** (>300 participants) we investigated to what extent prior simulation findings
on variable group sizes in collaborative search carry over to the real world. We made a number of contributions:

- First of all, we extended [SearchX](https://github.com/felipemoraes/searchx), our synchronous collaborative search framework with 
algorithmic mediation components as well as features enabling efficient use of SearchX for crowdsourcing studies, 
that we successfully deployed in a crowd-sourcing setup with hundreds of crowd-workers and different
levels of user and task synchronisation.
- We found most prior simulation-based results on the impact of group size
on behaviour and search effectiveness **to not hold** in our user study with
several hundred *crowd-workers*.
- Importantly, in our study - conducted across three difficult recall-oriented
search topics - **we do not observe diminishing returns** (measured in recall)
when scaling up group sizes from two to six collaborators. Our results
indicate that a further scaling up of group sizes, found to be statistically
significant, is feasible with existing collaborative search features and can
potentially lead to new research avenues in the collaborative search space.
