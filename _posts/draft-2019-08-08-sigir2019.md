description: A research design pattern exercise

### Introduction

A few weeks ago, Philip Guo wrote [a blog post about research design patterns](http://pgbovine.net/research-design-patterns.htm). I have recommended the post to most of my graduate students, as it shows nicely the rather structured way one can go about in *finding* new research questions to tackle.

## Seinfeld

```
dig deep into something that's right there in front of everyone but others haven't investigated yet
```

- Hate Speech Detection is Not as Easy as You May Think: A Closer Look at Model Validation https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331262
- Controlling Risk of Web Question Answering https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331261

## Inside-Out

```
turn commonly-accepted assumptions inside-out in an extreme way
```

## All the things

```
stretching an idea to the most ridiculous extreme
```

## Best of both worlds

```
think about two existing things that each have complementary benefits and drawbacks and try to combine them into a hybrid with the best aspects of both
```

- To Model or to Intervene: A Comparison of Counterfactual and Online Learning to Rank from User Interactions https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331269
- Answering Complex Questions by Joining Multi-Document Evidence with Quasi Knowledge Graphs https://doi.org/10.1145/3331184.3331252

## Back to the future

```
taking older ideas in your field that were hot a few decades ago and adding a modern twist to them
```

## Horizontal transfer

```
transfer a well-known idea in one field horizontally to another field
```

## Vertical transfer

```
using lower-level machinery to achieve higher-level goals, thus transferring ideas from lower to higher levels of abstraction
```

## Mr. Beast

```
spend an absurd amount of time doing what your peers won't
```

## Force of nature

```
This approach works when you have access to a piece of technology or infrastructure that others don't, so you're well-positioned to do certain kinds of research that your peers can't.
```

## Nelson - HA HA!

```
Nelson research happens when you have access to some unique data set that others don't.
```
