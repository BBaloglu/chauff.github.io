title: EMNLP 2018
---

Once a year, I try to attend an NLP or ML conference, usually picking the one that is closest in terms of location.
In 2016 I was at [ACL in Berlin](https://chauff.github.io/2016-08-12-acl2016/), in 2017 I attended 
[ICLR in Toulon](https://chauff.github.io/2017-04-25-iclr2017/) and this year I made the trip to [EMNLP in Brussels](http://emnlp2018.org/).

EMNLP is short for *Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing* and arguably, this conference
is most closely related to my own research area IR. As almost all reputable ML/NLP venues, the conference had a record number of
submissions (>2100) and participants (~2500) this year. Overall, 549 papers were accepted and split between oral and poster sessions.
Everything happened in parallel (not just oral sessions, but also poster sessions), apart from they keynotes and 
best paper session, which means i missed about 90% of everything that was out there.

Before the 3-day conference itself, there were two days of workshops and co-located conferences. I attended the 
[Search-Oriented Conversational AI workshop](https://scai.info/) and the [BlackboxNLP workshop](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/).
Each one had several hundred participants, with many great talks! 

I was impressed that, despite the focus on the empirical work (or maybe because of it?), many presentations were void
of almost any formula - which is quite a contrast to SIGIR or CIKM where it sometimes seems like a challenge to put in
as many formulas as possible.

The EMNLP proceedings can be found [here](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/events/emnlp-2018).
